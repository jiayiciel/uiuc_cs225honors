# CS225 Honors - Spring 2016

Welcome to the CS225 Honors section repository. Here you will find the source 
code for all the demos I do in class. Every lesson will be a different branch 
that you will fetch and merge into your own master.

## Getting Started:

1. Click fork to create your own copy of the repo.
2. Once the repository is forked:
  * Click Members on the menu on the right hand side
  * Search for c-heeren and add Cinda as a Reporter
    (This allows me to have read-access to your files.)
    
## Cloning the CS225 Honors Repository

After you have forked your copy of the repo, you need to download it to your 
CS225honors working directory:

1. Open up your command line interface
2. Navigate to your cs225honors working directory
3. Run `git clone https://gitlab-beta.engr.illinois.edu/NETID/cs225honors.git`
    Make sure to replace NETID with your NetID
4. Run the following command to add a new remote:
`git remote add release https://gitlab-beta.engr.illinois.edu/cheeren/cs225honors.git`
    Your repo is now referred to as `master` and mine is `release`.
